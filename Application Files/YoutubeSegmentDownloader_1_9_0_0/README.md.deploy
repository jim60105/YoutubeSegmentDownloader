# Youtube Segment Downloader

## What's this?

A lifesaver for anyone who is doing video clipping/translating or any need to download segments from Youtube.

## Feature

**Download Youtube video in segment**\
In detail, you can download only one segment in the middle of the video instead of downloading the whole video.

**This software is built on yt-dlp and FFmpeg.**\
If you don't have them installed, this software will download them automatically at startup.

**Can accept Youtube clips too!**\
Try to put this in the Youtube Link textbox: [https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxdTb9o6I2pTr87wKgpO0kLEaZbYrkMDFv](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxdTb9o6I2pTr87wKgpO0kLEaZbYrkMDFv)\
It will be converted to id, start, and end time immediately.

**Use the Youtube login status in your browser.**\
Select your login browser and download the membership video/your private video.

**The output video format conforms to the Youtube recommendation for uploading!**\
[Recommended upload encoding settings - YouTube Help](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171/)

**The download format can be specified.**\
Input [the format](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#format-selection) such as `303+251`
> Note: The video will be downloaded in this format and will ALWAYS be re-encoded to mp4 format.\
> Re-encoded is needed after cutting the video. Please read the details below.

**I18n 多國語系**\
我做了中文介面\
I only speak Chinese. Give me PR if you make more languages!

**It can accept any yt-dlp supported site.**\
I only support Youtube, but this application can theoretically be used on [any site supported by yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).\
The actual situation depends on the video format and whether ffmpeg can index it correctly, but it's still worth a try.\
For reference, I have had success with Youtube, Twitch, and niconico.

## Why not just use yt-dlp with ffmpeg `-ss -to`?

Nope, not enough.

According to [FFmpeg docs](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#toc-Main-options) about `-ss`:
> Note that in most formats it is not possible to seek exactly, so ffmpeg will seek to the closest seek point *before* position. When transcoding and `-accurate_seek` is enabled (the default), this extra segment between the seek point and position will be decoded and discarded. When doing stream copy or when `-noaccurate_seek` is used, it will be preserved.

Then the download is actually a streaming copy, so you won't get an accurate cut of it.

For example, downloading [this video](https://youtu.be/89kXyUCenD0) from 230s ~ 250s

```bash
yt-dlp --downloader ffmpeg --downloader-args "ffmpeg_i:-ss 230 -to 250" 89kXyUCenD0 
```

> yt-dlp `--download-sections "*230-250"` is actually equivalent to `--downloader ffmpeg --downloader-args "ffmpeg_i:-ss 230 -t 20"` [*ref](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/5ec1b6b71689d2f0cbdcd2b6c4dd861fb2fcf911#diff-045340cd706a52a49d1614a44d092c244144486fdd4101f4b56ae644ac9fdd04R452-R455)

would result in a video duration of 29.98 seconds, with the first 7 seconds being corrupted. This is *inaccurate* by, well, about 10 seconds. This is because the last seek point is around 220s, so it cuts off 220s ~ 250s.

To solve this, use ffmpeg to seek it again *with transcoding*.

```bash
ffmpeg -sseof -20 -i just_downloaded.webm good.webm
```

> `-sseof` likes the `-ss` option but relative to the "end of file".

So, you have to do two steps, plus a simple math calculation. It's not that much of a hassle, but it's enough to get a lazy programmer move.
